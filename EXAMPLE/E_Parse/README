To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- Parse_files.ipynb

If you run the Parse_files nb without any changes:
- you should get qmefp_libefp_631Gd.csv 
  since I ended up using only two methane in water geometries, the df has 10 rows. 


Following steps:
- this dataframe (csv file) contains all the data we will use for training!


Important information: 
- The meanings of each columns are follows
- System energy = the total qm energy from the qm/efp file. This is the energy of the qm region in the presence of the efp region
- Gas energy = the gas phase qm energy. so we run a gas phase qm calculation using qchem. So energy of the qm region without the efp region
the difference between system energy and gas energy is the interaction energy but not quite
- Efp energy = the energy of the individual efp fragments interacting with only each other. This is the energy withouht the qm region present
- Interaction energy = System energy - gas energy, so this number is the total interactions; the qm region interacting with the efp fragments and also efp fragments interacting with each other
- Corr energy =  Interaction energy - Efp energy, this is the true interaction between just the qm region and the efp region. So we take the total interaction and subtract out the efp-efp interactions
Corr energy is the energy that we will train to!
