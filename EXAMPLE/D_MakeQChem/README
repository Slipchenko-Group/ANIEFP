To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- MakeQMEFP.ipynb
- MakeGasQM_and_EFP.ipynb

If you run the MakeQMEFP nb without any changes:
- you should get mol1_63_s_water_5_qmefp.in and similar files for the libefp files that finished successfully

If you run the MakeGasQM_and_EFP nb without any changes:
- you should get mol1_63_s_water_5_gas.in and similar files for each of the QMEFP input files created above
- you should also get mol1_63_s_water_5_efp.in and similar files for each of the QMEFP input files

Following steps:
- run the qchem jobs
  before running the jobs make sure you have a copy of the water.efp file in the directory (found in MakeMAKEFP folder)
- copy the output files here (if you check them you will see not all of them converged)
