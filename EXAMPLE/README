This is my attempt at explaining how to use the scripts/notebooks I wrote to go from a gro file (or smi) to the csv we need for training.
The folders are in alphabetical order, so start from A_smiles2gro, then B_MakeMAKEFP and so on.
I recommend to start by creating your own version of the EXAMPLE folder with the same subdirectories.
Then for each subdirectory read the README file and follow the instructions.
The README file in each subdirectory will tell you which files you need before you begin and it will also tell you which files you should get at the end.
Samples of the files are also included in each subdirectory for your reference, in addition to some extra files you might need along the way (such as water.efp).
