To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- MakeLibEFP.ipynb
- gro files for which you want to run makefp, such as mol1_centered_solv_86.gro

If you run the MakeLibEFP nb without any changes:
- you should get mol1_86_s_water_5.in and similar files for each of the gro files

Following steps:
- run the libefp jobs on the cluster 
  you can use elpot.sb to submit the jobs, but replace '/scratch/halstead/c/cviquezr/libefp-master/efpmd/src/efpmd' with the correct path to your libefp
  before running the jobs make sure you have the efp files in the same direcotry as the input files (created in MakeMAKEFP)
  you will also need the water.efp file (also found in the MakeMAKEFP folder)
- copy the output files here (if you check them you will see not all of them converged)


IMPORTANT NOTE!
I got my structures from an MD simulation with pbc, so I moved the molecules such that they would be centered around the QM region (which I shifted to the origin: 0,0,0)
If the MD is from QChem without pbc, it might be best to not shift the system and simply use the exact coordinates from the MD output, in that case comment or fix lines in MakeLibEFP that call 'move_molecules' function.
You might also want to comment or fix lines that call the 'fix_box' function if you want to keep all solvent molecules. 


not all libefp jobs will converge, just like how not all makefp jobs will converge. it is okay
