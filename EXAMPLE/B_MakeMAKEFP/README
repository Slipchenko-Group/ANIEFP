To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- MakeMAKEFP.ipynb
- gro files for which you want to run makefp, such as mol1_centered_solv_86.gro
- water.efp

If you run the MakeMAKEFP nb without any changes:
- you should get mol1_86_s.inp and similar files for each of the gro files

Following steps:
- run these makefp jobs in the cluster (you need GAMESS), this will give you the .log files
- copy the .efp files here (these are written to the scratch)
- run fix_name.py with python3 to replace $FRAGNAME with the correct fragment name for each file 

- the makefp jobs are GAMESS input files, they are the .inp files. You will need an installation of GAMESS in order to run these
