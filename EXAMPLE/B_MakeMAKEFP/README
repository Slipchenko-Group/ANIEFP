To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- MakeMAKEFP.ipynb
- gro files for which you want to run makefp, such as mol1_centered_solv_86.gro
- water.efp

If you run the MakeMAKEFP nb without any changes:
- you should get mol1_86_s.inp and similar files for each of the gro files

Following steps:
- run these makefp jobs in the cluster (you can use makefp.sb to submit the jobs), this will give you the .log files
- copy the .efp files here (these are written to the scratch)
- run fix_name.py with python3 to replace $FRAGNAME with the correct fragment name for each file 


using makefp.sb will not work for you, you need to create your own bash or slurm script to run the GAMESS job
I just left it there in case someone doesnt know anything and wants to know how to run a GAMESS job
