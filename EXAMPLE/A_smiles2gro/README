To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- smiles2gro.ipynb
- chembl_nomore15_CHNO_diverse10K.smi
- water.gro
- md.sb
- envs.sh

md.sb and envs.sh are files that were used to run the jobs on our own clusters and will not work for everyone else
run your calculations in your own way, but i left the files in so if someone who doesnt know wants to see, they can see

If you run the smiles2gro nb without any changes:
- from STEP 1 you should get mol0.gro and mol1.gro
  you will need to change the value of n_smiles to get the gro for all the molecules
- from STEP 2 you should get mol0_centered.gro, mol1_centered.gro, mol0_centered_solv.gro and mol1_centered_solv.gro
  make sure water.gro exists!
- from STEP 3 you should get mol0_centered_solv.in and mol1_centered_solv.in and diverse_mols_systems.csv
- from STEP 4 you should get mol0_centered_solv.out and mol1_centered_solv.out
  you can use md.sb to submit the jobs
  make sure to have envs.sh in the folder!
  I only ran MD for mol1 so the first file is missing
- from STEP 5 you should get 4 files with names like mol1_centered_solv_86.gro but 86 might be replace by different numbers
