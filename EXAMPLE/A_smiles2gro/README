To start make sure you have the following files in the directory:
- smiles2gro.ipynb: the jupyter notebook that has all the steps with instructions and explanations
- chembl_nomore15_CHNO_diverse10K.smi: the smiles file with 10,000 different molecules from FreeSolv, we will grab from this
- water.gro: just a water GROMACS structure, we will be solvating with this

you will also need rdkit installed in your python environment for the jupyter notebook
install it here: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html

If you run the smiles2gro nb without any changes:
- from STEP 1 you should get mol0.gro and mol1.gro
  you will need to change the value of n_smiles to get the gro for all the molecules
- from STEP 2 you should get mol0_centered.gro, mol1_centered.gro, mol0_centered_solv.gro and mol1_centered_solv.gro
  make sure water.gro exists!
- from STEP 3 you should get mol0_centered_solv.in and mol1_centered_solv.in and diverse_mols_systems.csv
 at this point you need to be able to run QChem in some way, the .in files are for Qchem jobs.
 so run them in whatever way you need to, but then make sure the output files are in this directory
- from STEP 4 you should get mol0_centered_solv.out and mol1_centered_solv.out
  I only ran MD for mol1 so the first file is missing
- from STEP 5 you should get 4 files with names like mol1_centered_solv_86.gro but 86 might be replace by different numbers
